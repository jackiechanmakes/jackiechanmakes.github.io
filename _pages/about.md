Hi! I'm Jackie Chan. 

I graduated **with honors** with a **B.S. in Chemical Engineering** from **Caltech** and am currently pursuing a **M.S. in Computer Science** at **Georgia Tech**. Along the way, I've developed a strong set of technical skills and am continually refining my craft by learning, growing, and applying new concepts. 

I created this site for a few reasons: 
1. To deepen my understanding of the material that interest me 
2. To create a personal reference to revisit what I've learned and built
3. To help others grasp the concepts I'm exploring
4. To ensure I move beyond passive learning and actively apply new ideas and concepts 
5. To practice my storytelling and communication skills

If you have any feedback or thoughts, please feel free to share! Thank you for reading.
