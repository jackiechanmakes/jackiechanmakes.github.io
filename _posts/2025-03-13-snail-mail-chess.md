My friend, Elias, and I have decided to play a game of chess through snail mail. Come with me as I build a digital chess board we both can use to keep track of our moves! 
<!--more-->

# Motivation: 
- After playing phone tag for way too many months, Elias and I joked around that we would have better luck catching up if we snail mailed each other, which sparked the idea of playing a game of chess by mail to stay connected.  
- Elias has made his first move in a letter, which has made me realize that I don't have a chessboard to keep track of moves! After mulling over my options, I've concluded that there's no space for a chess board to be perpetually out in my very small apartment, which means finding a digital solution.
- There's probably options online that more or less does what I want but what's the fun in that?! I like the idea of Elias and I having our own special place on the internet specifically tailored to our use case to play :) I imagine this would help Elias too in case his cat ever decides she wants to play swat the chess pieces. 

# Brainstorming out loud
We're just at the beginning stages so here's just a hodgepodge of ideas:
- Focus on MVP and make it fancier later because the letter exchanges are already rolling in! I'm not going to hold off spending time with Elias just because this idea of mine isn't polished yet
- This would be a web app because that's what's most easily accessible for us. I also have experience writing mobile apps, but logistics around that won't be as convenient given the devices we each own. 
- I would need:
  - a persistent database so SQL
  - front end for us to view the board so html/css/javascript or react?
  - the chess rules/logic! 
  - a way to make sure someone who may stumble on my project doesn't change our game state
- App needs to be connected to the internet so both Elias and I can access it from our respective location

# Next steps
- Design of what the front end could look like
- Design of the back end/database  
  - What would the rows/columns of the DB look like? 
- Figure out what tech stack to use for frontend and backend
- Remember the chess rules... 

If it isn't fun, why do it?
